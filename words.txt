Hello, Myself Shreyas MN, a Computer Science Graduate Student in State Univeristy of 
New York at Binghamton. I am from india. I am struggling to make my basic expenses itself
and my parents are finding it really hard to send money to me every month. But at the 
same time, I am extremely interested in taking this course as i will be start giving 
interviews from the coming December, 2016. I believe it is great course and will definitely
help many students like me to crack the coding and Software engineering interviews. 
I am with no money and definitely in need of your help. it would be really great if 
I get access to this course. i would like to conduct such courses for students who
are in need in the coming future. Many Thanks.!!		
Currently I am enrolled in Object oriented programming in Java and finished the first week
of course well before the deadline. I am doing it with all the love i have towards Computer Science
and really want to master the Software engineering interview course too as i would be giving 
interviews after this summer. I believe its a great course and definitely help me in cracking
real interviews. I am in great need of your financial assistance to take this course.
This course certificate could get me more and more interviews and I can put all the knowledge
of these courses to help myself and my struggling family. Many Thanks.!!
I would like to participate actively in the discussion forum and give my sincere ideas 
in helping other students issues/problems. I will complete the assignments and projects
on my own and will not post any solutions which could help other  students passing this
course without any effort. I would like to give suggestions to instructors about how they 
can really improve the course over the time and make course still better.
Many Thanks.!!
